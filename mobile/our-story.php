			<h1>Our Story</h1>

			<p>Spoleto combines the speed of fresh-casual service with the sophistication of an Italian restaurant and gourmet-quality food. This is what sets us apart. Spoleto further defines the uniqueness of our concept by offering a seasonal menu based on the availability of fresh local products and an endless number of guest-selected food combinations.</p>

			<p>A choice of 30 authentic Italian-inspired toppings gives everyone a chance to create meals that inspire their palate. Guests can craft a pasta dish, flatbread or salad and interact, talk and laugh with our chefs to experiment with a variety of fresh ingredients in our open kitchen. You can choose to indulge in richer ingredients
			like meats and cheeses, as well as a full complement of fresh vegetables, whole grains and fruits.</p>

			<p>Spoleto has made it our mission to use ingredients in their simplest, most natural form, depending on daily deliveries of seasonal produce from locally owned farms. Spoleto sources produce that is nutrient-rich and organic when possible.</p>

			<p>This is a practice we have embraced since Spoleto was founded, long before “farm to table” became a trendy buzzword. </p>

			<p>The limitless possibilities of combinations allow our guests to have a unique interactive experience during every visit to Spoleto. For the indecisive guest, you can also select from one
			of our chef-inspired pasta, flatbread and salad recipes. We care about what you like. We also care about giving you fresh, flavorful and healthy options.</p>

			<p>There are no worries about meeting dietary restrictions or asking for special substitutions. You are the chef. It’s your way. Spoleto is where you can exercise your Culinary Freedom.</p>
